NeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to problems from the NeetCode roadmap.

I'm solving problems to improve my skills in data structures and algorithms, mainly using C#.

Each folder is organized by topic (e.g., Arrays, Trees, Dynamic Programming) and includes clean and readable code.

Feel free to check out the solutions or use them for reference.
